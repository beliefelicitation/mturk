        We now ask you to use the same interface you have worked with the last few minutes to make <strong>two predictions</strong> regarding future real world events.
    </p><p>In both cases we would like you to insert a "distribution" of the likelihood of different events.</p><p> You will <b>not receive extra payment</b> for these two predictions, but we hope you will try and provide your best prediction anyways.    </div>
